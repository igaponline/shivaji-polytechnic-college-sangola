Artificial Intelligence

It refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence. 

These tasks include reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and even understanding language.

AI technologies consists of following terminologies

1. Machine Learning
2. Deep Learning
3. Data Analysis
4. Data Science
5. Data Engineering

and many more...

AI - It enables machine to think and perform tasks without human intervention.

ML - It is subset of AI. It deals with development algorithms which helps to take decisions.

DL - It is subset of ML. It has multineural network architecture. It mimics human brain.

DS - It is study of data to extract meaningful insights using different tools, programming and mathematics.

DA - It involves collecting, cleaning, transforming, describing, modeling and interpreting data to help in business decision making.

DE - It involves building and maintaining data pipelines.

To develop Machine Learning projects we use different libraries in python. Some of the important libraries are

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib and Seaborn
4. ScikitLearn

To use these libraries we need to install them using following command

pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install scikit-learn

List in python

friends = ["Abhijit", "Kishor", "Vivek", "Ganesh"]

To find nth element we must iterate through entire list and it is time consuming.

To solve this issue 'Travis Oliphant' introduced Array in numpy library in 2005.

Array is collection of elements of similar datatype.

Array stores elements in continueous manner.

0 111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111

0 111 1111 1111 1111

1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64  = 127

Stock Price Prediction

--------------------------------------
In ML, we use diffent predefined algorithms to predict progressing value, class value or cluster(group) value for given input.
--------------------------------------
ML has different categories

1. Regression
2. Classification
3. Clustering
4. Association

---------------------------------------

To solve projects like Car Price Prediction, House Price Prediction, Stock Price Prediction we use Linear Regression Algorithm.

This algorithm is based on concept of straight line and it uses following formula

y = mx + b

m - coefficient(slope)
b - intercept(y's value for 0)

If there are multiple parameters(input) to predict value we use following formula

y = m1x1 + m2x2 + .... + mnxn + b

Car Price Prediction Project using Linear Regression

Download dataset from github

- Goto github.com and search for 'igaponline'

- https://github.com/igaponline?tab=repositories

- Download zip file

- In ML project we get data in CSV(Comma Seperated Values) format.

- To load csv file in project we use pandas library

#Import libraries

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

#Import csv file

df = pd.read_csv("quikr_car.csv")

In AI projects we get data from different sources. This data is not cleaned. ML algorithm needs clean data and we need to clean that data.

Before cleaning we need to analyse data.

# Find no of columns

df.columns

#Check datatypes of columns

df.info()

We found that 
1. there are 6 columns
2. Price is output column
3. All columns has 'object'(string) datatype
	Expected datatypes are
	
	name - object
	company -  object
	year - int
	Price - float
	kms_driven - int
	fuel_type - object
	
4. Many records has null values(empty)
5. year column has many non-year values
	df["year"].unique()
6. Price column has ',' in every value and 'Ask For Price'
	df["Price"].unique()
7. kms_driven column has ',' and ' kms' in every value.
	df["kms_driven"].unique()
8. fuel_type column has null values
	df["fuel_type"].unique()
9. company column has wrong values.
	df["company"].unique()
10. name column has wrong values
	df["name"].unique()

Data Cleaning

1. We will remove records who has null values

df.dropna(inplace = True)

While cleaning data we must clean numerical columns first and then go for string.

2. Change datatype of column year to int

df["year"] = pd.to_numeric(df["year"], errors = 'coerce')

3. Change Price column datatype to float. 
	1. But every record contains ',' in it.
		Repalce ',' from every value

	for i in df.index:
		price = df.loc[i, "Price"]
		price = price.replace(',', '')
		df.loc[i, "Price"] = price
	2. Change datatype
	
	df["Price"] = pd.to_numeric(df["Price"], errors = 'coerce')
	df.dropna(inplace = True)
	
4. Clean 'kms_driven' column

	for i in df.index:
		kms_driven = df.loc[i, "kms_driven"]
		kms_driven = kms_driven.replace(',', '')
		kms_driven = kms_driven.replace(' kms', '')
		df.loc[i, "kms_driven"] = kms_driven

	df["kms_driven"] = pd.to_numeric(df["kms_driven"], errors = 'coerce')
	df.dropna(inplace = True)

5. Remove company name from name column

	for i in df.index:
		name = df.loc[i, "name"]
		company = df.loc[i, "company"]
		name = name.replace(company, '').strip()
		df.loc[i, "name"] = name
		
6. #Check if there are any duplicate records
	df.duplicated().value_counts()
	
	#Remove duplicate records
	df.drop_duplicates(inplace = True)

7. Save cleaned file to use in next part

	df.to_csv("cleaned_data.csv")


ML algorithm needs data in numerical format, because it uses statistical methods and mathematics.

Create new notebook - implementation.ipynb

#Import libraries

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

#load cleaned data

df = pd.read_csv("cleaned_data.csv")

#divide dataset into training and testing
